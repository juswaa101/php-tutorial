        5. Some Basic Syntax
        - PHP statements end with a semicolon (;)
        - PHP is case-sensitive
        - In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are NOT case-sensitive
        - Comments in PHP are same as in C++ and JavaScript

    // Example:
    $x = 5;
    $y = 10;
    echo $x + $y;
