        4. Introduction to Variables
        - A variable is a container for storing data.
        - PHP has no command for declaring a variable.
        - A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        - Variables are case-sensitive.

    $age = 25;
    echo "My name is $name and I am $age years old.";
